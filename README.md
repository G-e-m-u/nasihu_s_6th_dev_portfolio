Animated Ferris Wheel.

This code demonstrates strong expertise in CSS layout and animation by combining positioning, transforms, and keyframes to create a fully animated Ferris wheel without JavaScript.
It shows a clear understanding of absolute positioning and transform origins to correctly anchor rotations, using nth-of-type selectors to evenly distribute spokes and cabins around a circular structure.
Responsive design awareness is evident through the use of viewport units with max-size constraints, ensuring the wheel scales gracefully across screen sizes. The animation logic is especially sophisticated:
the wheel rotates continuously while the cabins counter-rotate to remain upright, reflecting a solid grasp of coordinate systems, transform inheritance, and timing functions.
